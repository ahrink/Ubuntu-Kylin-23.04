two wallets that may stir interest to be installed on a Desktop,  Exodus and Ledger -- both are fine and secured keeping your coins 
in your pocket not on a centralized “Bank” or some new unsafe website. 
Just keep in mind that this subject is old pertaining to the separation of hardware and software – in principals.

# 2. click on download-desktop select Download Linux (.deb)

# 3. cd /home/sananton/Downloads

# 4. apt install ./exodus-linux-x64-23.8.1.deb

Note: UKUI menu should have the link ready to “right-click” and place an Icon on desktop.

… ledger is French… [however, all paths are fictive to example and suggests the use of unique-names also original]

# 7. wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash

# 8. Use the desktop file explorer to create a desktop icon/link to the file residing in /home/sananton/xOLdg/ledger-live-desktop-2.64.2-linux-x86_64.AppImage

Note: while launching the ledger from the Ubuntu desktop exercise patience – as it takes almost a minute to pop its window for usage. 
As you know, it does require internet.
